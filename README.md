We use 6h-frequency data to train our HMM model, and recognize hidden state by using observations of momentum and volume, which is 6h return, 12h return, 3.5d return, 15d return and 6h volume in detail. 
The hidden state is divided into five types, we define each state based on the cumulative returns during the training period. Recognition for ETH is shown here.
